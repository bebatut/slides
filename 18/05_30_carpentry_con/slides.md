### Interactive learning via hands-on tutorials built around a "research story"

![Screenshot with 2 web-browsers open side-by-side: one pointed at the current tutorial and the other at a Galaxy instance](images/interactive_hands_on.png) <!-- .element width="100%" -->

Note:

Designed to be interactive and built around Galaxy

Built around a "research story"
- Introduction
- Data upload (downsampling)
- Hands-on with different steps

Metadata to help trainees and instructors to keep track of the training goads
- Learning objectives
- Prerequisites
- Questions: Regular assessments with question boxes

---
### An effective training infrastructure

- Interactive learning platform
- Support for current research problems
- Usable for effective training for individual users & instructors
- FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and Open
- Technical support (tools, data, etc)
- Community driven (content creation and maintenance)
