CarpentryCon - Community-Driven Training for Biological Data Analysis with the Galaxy Training Network
======================================================================================================

Time slot: 5min


The primary problem with the explosion of biomedical datasets is not the data itself, not computational resources, and not the required storage space, but the general lack of trained and skilled researchers to manipulate and analyze these data. Eliminating this problem requires development of comprehensive educational resources. 

Here we present a community-driven framework that enables modern, interactive teaching of data analytics in life sciences and facilitates the development of training materials (training.galaxyproject.org). The key feature of our system is that it is not a static but a continuously improved collection of tutorials. By coupling tutorials with a web-based analysis framework, biological researchers can learn by performing computation themselves through a web-browser without the need to install software or search for example datasets.
