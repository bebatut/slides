### Galaxy: a great solution !

![UseGalaxy screenshot](images/usegalaxy.png) <!-- .element width="60%" -->

- Web interface for numerous bioinformatics tools
- No issue with computer configuration during training

----
### Requirements for an effective training infrastructure

- Interactive learning platform
- Support for current research problems
- Usable for effective training for individual users & instructors
- Community driven (content creation and maintenance)
- FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and Open

### Interactive learning via hands-on tutorials built around a "research story"

![Screenshot with 2 web-browsers open side-by-side: one pointed at the current tutorial and the other at a Galaxy instance](images/interactive_hands_on.png) <!-- .element width="100%" -->

Note:

Designed to be interactive and built around Galaxy

Built around a "research story"
- Introduction
- Data upload (downsampling)
- Hands-on with different steps

Metadata to help trainees and instructors to keep track of the training goads
- Learning objectives
- Prerequisites
- Questions: Regular assessments with question boxes
