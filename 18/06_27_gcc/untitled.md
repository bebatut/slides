The Galaxy Training Network has developed an infrastructure to deliver interactive training based on Galaxy: one central place ([https://training.galaxyproject.org](https://training.galaxyproject.org)) to aggregate training materials covering many current research topics.

Each topic is supported by different tutorials built to support interactive learning around a "research story" (usually the reproduction of a scientific paper). The tutorials can then easily be used for effective training to support individual users in their self-learning effort and also instructors during workshops.
